Student: Tyler Osborne
Class: Game Development 1 - 0NA (Friday mornings from 8:50-10:40am)

I created this game within the past 4 weeks, making progress every week, with changes to gameplay aspects.

I first wanted to make a single-player (quake-like) shooter but after some time working on it, 
I changed my mind and made a zombie shooter.

I've been having so much trouble with unity and i got some things working (enemies moving towards player and bullets firing) but couldn't get somethings done (destroying enemies when hit and bullet disappearing when hitting enemies, as well as UI)

The mark I would like to get is 60% because I've implemented some of the stuff we've done in class, except for advanced AI

Sorry that I missed some class due to me being sick for most of the semester and I couldn't catch up on the thigs I missed...

Thanks for teaching me on making Unity games and hope to see you around soon!
